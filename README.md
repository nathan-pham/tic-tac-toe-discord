## Inspiration
Tic Tac Toe is about as simple as board games get, and yet it’s still so fun! We wanted to share a discord bot that can be added to any server to keep the fun and our love of Tic Tac Toe alive.

## What it does
The Tic Tac Toe Discord bot lets you pair up with a friend to play tic tac toe! Currently the bot features 5 commands, including new, quit, play, recap, and help. “New” creates a new game with another player, “quit” deletes the game, “recap” shows you the game board, and “help” is intentionally designed to be unhelpful. 

## How we built it
We built our Tic Tac Toe Discord bot using *Node.js* to host the server and *Discord.js* to handle all requests coming  from Discord. We hosted the bot on *Repl.it*. 

## Challenges we ran into
A main challenge we ran into was organizing and checking our code. It’s a short and sweet program, but oh were there typos and edge cases we needed to cover before our Tic Tac Toe Discord bot was as robust as it could be.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud that we were able to complete this Discord bot in the time we had. We’re also very happy about how robust it is - there are no errors, there’s user checking and game checking and input validation, all written in a neat and organized way.

## What we learned
We learned how to program a discord bot in Node.js. While we used a template to start off, we researched the different functions that our bot could use to make the code as clean as possible. We also discovered how to host separate games at once, through our implementation of rooms within our Discord bot.

## What's next for Tic Tac Toe Discord Bot
Tic Tac Toe shouldn’t be the end of the list of board games for our discord bot. Chess, Checkers, and even Backgammon can be added to it, with cute ascii art to go along.
